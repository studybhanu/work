# Hack Data work



A technology firm, hacked and armed with forensic data on attack sessions, seeks assistance to determine if a third hacker was involved among three suspects. 
The dataset includes session time, data transferred, tools used, servers/pages corrupted, location (likely obscured by VPNs), and typing speed. 
The firm suspects the hackers shared attack responsibilities evenly.
The challenge lies in using clustering techniques to group the unlabeled data into clusters that correspond to the hackers, considering their balanced attack distribution.






# Merchant Fraud work



To detect fraudulent merchants in an ecommerce platform selling counterfeit goods, machine learning can play a crucial role. 
By analyzing a diverse set of features such as product pricing, customer reviews, transaction frequency, seller's history, and product categories, a predictive model can be trained. 
This model, often employing techniques like supervised learning (classification algorithms), can learn patterns of legitimate and fraudulent behavior. 
By continuously refining its understanding through data, it can automatically identify suspicious merchants based on deviations from established norms, enabling the ecommerce platform to take proactive measures against fraud and protect consumers.

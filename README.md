A technology firm, hacked and armed with forensic data on attack sessions, seeks assistance to determine if a third hacker was involved among three suspects. 
The dataset includes session time, data transferred, tools used, servers/pages corrupted, location (likely obscured by VPNs), and typing speed. 
The firm suspects the hackers shared attack responsibilities evenly.
The challenge lies in using clustering techniques to group the unlabeled data into clusters that correspond to the hackers, considering their balanced attack distribution.
